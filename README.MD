# Pruning and Masking weight zoos to train Meta-Models

This code is designed to be compatible with the repo: https://github.com/neel-alex/nninn/tree/ctc_repl/src/nninn. The aim is to augment the weight space by implementing different forms of pruning on the trained weights as well as masking them.
